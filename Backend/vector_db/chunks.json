Pizza is without any doubt the most popular and appreciated food in the world. Simple yet tasty, versatile and easy to enjoy everywhere. Perfect for sharing with family and friends pizza can easily satisfy and meet everyone’s taste. Today we can find so many different types of pizza that differ in terms of toppings, thickness and preparation methods, but the traditional authentic Italian pizza as we all know it is made of three simple key ingredients: flour, tomato and fiordilatte mozzarella.WELCOME The origins of this popular food are still uncertain. There are evidences that the Ancient Greeks used to eat slices of flatbread topped with savouries, but it was something far from the pizza as we intend it now, also because tomatoes had only been imported to Europe many centuries later, after Christopher A manual to discover the secrets behind world’s favourite food: Pizza. Colombus discovered America in the XV century. Modern pizza was probably invented by a Neapolitan baker, Raffaele Esposito, in 1889 when in occasion of Queen Margherita and King Umberto I of Savoy visit to Naples, he created a pizza using tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil leaves to represent the colours of the Italian flag. PERFECT FOR SHARING wITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS PIZZA CAN EASILY SATISFy AND MEET EvER yONE’ S TASTE. hE CREATED A PIZZA USING TOMATO SAUCE, MOZZARELLA AND bASIL LEA vES TO REPRESENT THE COLOURS OF THE ITALIAN FLAG . IT ALICA TESSEN » PIZZA GUIDE » 3The Queen liked this pizza so much that it was named “pizza Margherita” in her honour. Despite that, it was only during the first half of the 20th century that pizza became famous all around the world when people from the South of Italy started to migrate to Northern Italy first and then to other countries in Europe and in America. Today pizza is the symbol of the Italian cuisine in the world and to celebrate this incredible food we have created this brochure to share with you our knowledge and suggestions.

There are different types of flour, learning the differences between them is fundamental in order to obtain the specific desired result. Flour is obtained from the milling of wheat. There are two different kinds of wheat: 01 FLOUR FOR PIZZA COMMON WHEAT (Triticum Aestivus), also known as bread or soft wheat Characterised by very small round shaped granules and white in colour . It is mainly used to make bread, pizza and bakery products in general, fresh and egg pasta. DURUM WHEAT (Triticum Durum). The flour obtained from durum wheat, instead, is called “semola” and has larger granules with a yellow-amber colour , mainly used for the production of dry pasta. FLOUR FOR PIZZA The flour used for pizza dough is the one obtained from common wheat (called simply wheat), for this reason in this guide we will always refer to common wheat when referring to flour . 1 2",

      "content": "IT ALICA TESSEN » PIZZA GUIDE » 5Everything starts from the common wheat kernel , sometimes called wheatberry. It is the seed from which the wheat plant grows and it is made of three distinct parts: bran, endosperm and germ. These three parts of the kernel are separated during the milling process. WhEAT FLOUR CAN bE CLASSIFIED IN: 00, 0, 1, 2 AND wHOLEWhEAT .THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FLOUR ASH CONTENT In Italy, the most common and recognised way to classify the different types of flour is based on the ash or mineral content, which depends on the amount of bran left if we were to burn 100g of flour . The lower the ash content, the whiter the flour since it means it has been produced from the milling of the endosperm only. Wholewheat flour , instead, has the highest level of ash content because the bran and the germ are present as well. Wheat flour can be classified in: 00, 0, 1, 2 and wholewheat.GERMENDOSPERMBRAN Included mainly in whole wheat flour , the bran (the outer part of the kernel) is another part of the kernel used to produce white flour even if in smaller quantities compared to the endosperm. It contains a small amount of protein and large quantities of minerals and of the three major B-vitamins. ENDOSPERM The endosperm is the source of white flour and contains the starch and the greatest amount of protein, carbohy - drates and iron. It is also the source for soluble fibre. GERM The inner part of the kernel, called germ, is normally separated from the flour milling because of its high fat content which compromises the shelf life of the flour . The germ, instead, is present in wholewheat flour and it is also possible to find it in artisanal stone-milled flour. BRAN The percentage of brand and endosperm depends on the refining level (milling and sifting) of the flour . 6 » IT ALICA TESSEN » PIZZA GUIDETYPE OF |FLOURASH CONTENT (% ON 100G OF FLOUR)CHARACTERISTICS RECOMMENDED FOR 00 0.55 It is the most refined type of flour because the bran is completely removed during the milling. The result is a white flour , highly ‘workable’ , rich in starch (and sugar) but poor in fiber and minerals. – Pastry, – Pasta – Bread – Pizza Considering that the dough using ‘00’ flour will be very soft. 0 0.6 Slight less refined then the ‘00’ , with a low bran content. – Baking products, – Pasta – Pastry 1 0.80 With a higher bran content, this less refined flour has a good balance between taste and nutrients content. The level of bran makes it richer in minerals and gives this flour a darker colour compared to the previous more refined ones. Like using the type ‘2’ and ‘wholewheat’ flour , the result is a pizza dough with a pleasant stronger taste and flavour compared to the previous ones. – High quality baking products – Bread – Pizza. 2 0.95 Also know as ‘semi-wholewheat’ flour , it is character - ised by larger granules and a high content of nutrients because of of the content of bran and kernel germ. Like the wholewheat flour , it has excellent nutritional charac - teristics but it is easier to process. – Pizza – Bread – Bakery products Wholewheat 1.30 min; 1.7 maxAs a consequence of a slower milling process, this flour is less refined than the previous ones and as a consequence has a very high nutrients contents, rich in fiber , vitamins, proteins and monerals.

FLOUR STRENGTH (W) ThE hIGHER THE LEVEL OF PROTEIN IN THE FLOUR, THE STRONGER THE FLOUR.Flour “strength” (indicated by the symbol ‘W’) represents the quantity of gluten that the flour develops and its subsequent capability to absorb water. The value of the ‘W’ is correlated to the protein content of the flour . When combined with water , flour proteins (gliadin and glutenin) form a protein complex called Gluten. This is the element that, during the kneading, absorbs water and during the leaving retains the carbon dioxide developed by the yeast. The higher the level of protein in the flour , the stronger the flour . A strong flour generates more gluten and, as a consequence, the dough will absorb more water and it will be more resistant to long raising.

      "content": "12 » IT ALICA TESSEN » PIZZA GUIDE Together with flour, Yeast is the most important ingredient for the preparation of pizza dough. Yeast is the leavening agent which allows the dough to rise. When mixed with flour, yeast feeds on flour sugars and creates alcohol and carbon dioxide, which forms air pockets trapped in the dough. As a result, the dough grows in size during the leavening process and becomes easily digestible. During the baking, the carbon dioxide dissolves leaving empty alveoli which gives the pizza crust an airy and fluffy texture. There are different types of yeast and choosing the right one is fundamental in order to achieve the desired results. DRIED YEAST Instant activate dry yeast is suitable for all kinds of pizza dough and it can be used directly in the flour during the first phase of the kneading. Thanks to its better consistency throughout time, the dried yeast when regenerated and used in the right quantities can give better results than fresh yeast. Instant dry yeast doesn’t need to be re-hydrated before use, simply add it to the dry ingredients of your dough. It is very important not to put the yeast in contact with cold temperatures. Therefore, it is better to mix it with flour before adding water . T o replace fresh yeast in a recipe, the dry yeast should be used in 40/50 % of the quantity of fresh yeast.SOURDOUGH Made from special powdered dried mother yeast, developed in collaboration with the faculty of Biology and genetics of the University of Parma, Le 5 Stagioni Naturkraft presents a perfect balance between the yeasts and the best bacterial lactic strains. It is recommended for all types of dough. When using Naturkraft it is advisable to reduce the quantity of beer yeast in the dough by 20%. 02 YEAST WHY USE SOURDOUGH? The Sourdough enriches the dough with flavors and scents and it allows the lactic fermentation to take place. The benefits of this type of fermentation are: longer shelf life and higher digestibility. Overall, sourdough is a natural dough improver that we highly recommend to use.

      "content": "IT ALICA TESSEN » PIZZA GUIDE » 13 In this chapter we will introduce you the most common ways of making pizza. We will provide you with an overview of what are the steps involved in every method, suggestions and recommendations. Please consider that there are many factors that can affect the process of making pizza (temperature, humidity, strength of the flour and so on). For this reason, the information provided below have to be considered as general guidelines that may have to be adapted to the specific need and situation. The main ingredients of pizza dough are flour, yeast, water and salt. The different methods used to prepare the pizza dough affect the quantity and the order in which these ingredients are mixed together. DIRECT DOUGH Direct dough is the traditional and most common method to make the dough, which donates the classic flavor and aroma to the pizza. It is based on alcoholic fermentation, obtained thanks to Brewer’s Y east (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae) and offers excellent results. Direct dough is made mixing all the ingredients - flour, water, salt and yeast (fresh or dry) - together. This is the most popular way of making pizza. It guarantees consistency to the dough, high digestibility and it is easy and quick to make. Based on the strength of the flour we use, we may opt for a direct method with short or long fermentation. The direct method with a short leavening time can be used with flour with a W (strength) around 220. After mixing and kneading all the ingredients together , the dough is left to rest and proof for a first fermentation that can last around 15-20 minutes. This step is followed by the shaping of the dough and by a second, longer proofing for about 8 - 12 hours at room temperature or until it doubles in size, before being ready to be used. Like the short one, the direct method with a long fermentation starts mixing all the ingredients together , but this time a stronger flour (with a W of at least 240) is needed. Another important factor to consider is that if we opt for a long fermentation, the quantity of yeast has to be reduced compared to the short method. Once kneaded, the dough is left resting at room temperature for around 20 minutes, covered with cling film. After this first short proofing, the dough has to be placed in the fridge at a temperature between +4° +6° C degrees for a time that can vary between a minimum of 12 hours to a maximum of 96 hours depending on the strength of the flour and the final product that we want to obtain. 03 WAYS OF MAKING PIZZA The most common methods of making pizza dough can be classified in: - Direct Dough - Indirect Dough: - Biga - Poolish - Natural YeastDIRECT DOUGh IS MADE MIXING ALL THE INGREDIENTS - FLOUR, wATER, SALT AND yEAST (FRESh OR DR y) - TOGETHER.",

      "content": "14 » IT ALICA TESSEN » PIZZA GUIDEINDIRECT DOUGH BIGA Biga was born in Italy and responds to the need to imitate the excellent results offered by the use of Mother Y east (or Natural Y east or Sourdough), without necessarily having to submit to its management methods, often considered too demanding. When making Biga, two types of fermentation are involved: the alcoholic and the lactic fermentation. This is why the taste of the final products obtained with this method reminds of the one of the Mother Y east (mostly of a “lactic” nature), without having to take care of periodic refreshments of the yeast.Biga is made using a strong flour with a strength between 280W and 400W. The preparation takes place in two distinct phases. In the first phase, flour is mixed with water and yeast. The hydration is low, from 30% to 50% of the dough (biga, in fact, is a dry pre-dough) and the quantity of dried yeast used is around 6g for each kg of flour . The temperature of the pre-dough should be constantly around 20-22° C degrees. In the second step, after a proofing time of 18 – 24 hours, the Biga is refreshed with flour , water and salt. Water has to be added in larger quantity compared to the flour , in order to rebalance the dough. CLASSIC BIGA (30% hydration) DOUGH MADE WITH BIGA (large air pockets) On the other hand, another way to make pizza dough is using the indirect methods which involve a “pre-dough” , that can be classified in “Biga” and “Poolish”. In the first phase, the pre-dough is made using flour, water and yeast and it is left to proof. In the second phase, the main dough is made refreshing the pre-dough with the rest of the ingredients.

BOTH IMPROVE THE AROMA AND FLAVORS OF THE DOUGHS IN WHICH THEY ARE USED, THANKS TO THE PROLONGED MA TURA TION TO WHICH THEY ARE SUBJECT , BUT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT ORIGINS AND EFFECTS. Compared to the direct dough, this method involves a lower quantity of yeast and as a result it ensures a better digestibility of the final product, a more intense taste and aroma, a better alveolation and a more extended shelf life.",

      "content": "IT ALICA TESSEN » PIZZA GUIDE » 15POOLISH Poolish method is very similar to Biga. The origins of its name are not clear yet, but it was probably named “Poolish” after the country where it was invented, Poland. It is characterized by a very high hydration and a homogeneous and dense alveolation. The final result using this method is a product with a long shelf life, highly digestible, fragrant and crusty. Differently from Biga, which is dry, Poolish has a liquid texture and is obtained by mixing together water and flour (with a W of at least 250) in the same proportion, with the addition of a percentage of yeast that differs based on the proofing time: – 1-2 hours proofing: 2.5% of yeast; – 4-5 hours proofing: 1.5% of yeast; – 6-7 hours proofing: 1% of yeast; – 8-9 hours proofing: 0.5% of yeast; – 10-12 hours proofing: 0.3% of yeast; – 13-14 hours proofing: 0.2% of yeast; – 15-16 hours proofing: 0.1% of yeast. (the quantity of yeast is expressed as a percentage of the flour weight) The ideal proofing temperature is 23C degrees circa. Poolish is ready once it has doubled its volume and when it forms a sort of dip in the middle. The percentage of Poolish normally used is between 20% and 35% of the total flour indicated on the recipe. After the fermentation, the Poolish is refreshed with water , flour and salt and then kneaded. After this step, the dough is left to rest for around 20 minutes before proceeding with the creation of dough balls.

Natural yeast donates unique aromas and flavors to the dough and dramatically increases the shelf-life of the final product, hindering the retrogradation of starches. Natural Y east is a mixture of flour and water subjected to spontaneous contamination by microorganisms (for the most part “yeasts”) present in the raw materials, coming from the air , from the environment, from the operator . These factors create a native bacterial microflora within the mass in which the culture of lactic bacteria predominates. Natural Y east is usually made mixing the water with Manitoba and a bit of sugar . It has to be let proof spon- taneously for 48 hours. After that, it needs to be refreshed daily with water and flour for at least 14 days before being used. The lactic bacteria present in sourdough preparations lower the pH of the pizza dough, helping to degrade the phytates. This produces doughs with a much lower phytate content than regular ones, which can be as much as 25-50% less. Natural Y east is commonly used to make bread and long leavening bakery products, but it can also be used for the pizza dough. The result will be a final product with a higher acidity, an intense aromatic bouquet, highly digestible and fragrant.

These rules and traditions were verbally passed down from fathers to sons for generations until the association united all the most prominent pizza chefs of Napoli in 1984. The Associazione states that the Pizza Napoletana has to be round shaped, with a diameter smaller than 35cm, has to present a thick fluffy edge and the pizza needs to be fragrant and soft. Also, authentic pizza Napoletana has the classic leopard skin on the edge, given by the high temperatures of the woodfired oven, but cannot have any burnt bits. For the sauce, recommended are hand-crushed peeled tomatoes, not too thick and with little bits of tomatoes still present in the sauce. The mozzarella to be used is the Fior di latte sliced in thick julienne stripes.

COOKING Depending on the style chosen could be cooked like a Neapolitan pizza or may need to be pre-cooked (like the one in the picture) Gourmet pizza is a modern version of the classic Neapolitan or Roman pizza we are used to. A gourmet pizza is a unique mix of top quality ingredients, flour, leavening methods and excellent, less common toppings, often seasonal. The real gourmet pizza emphasises the flavour of the dough and all the toppings are carefully selected in order to create unique tasting combinations. The use of mother yeast or biga is mandatory to ensure a dough that is soft, perfectly consistent and easily digestible. The visual presentation is very important when it comes to gourmet pizzas. A real gourmet pizza has to be served already cut in wedges and every sliced is considered a single “boccone” (bite) with the right amount of ingredients on top. Finding a list of ingredients to use to create a gourmet pizza is almost impossible, since every pizzaiolo can create their own combination of flavours and aromas. The most important aspect to consider is the quality of the ingredients that have to be excellent and authentic to create unique gourmet pairings. Burrata, Stracciatel- la, ‘nduja, porcini mushrooms, fresh truffles, caviar , Prosciutto di Parma DOP , Pesto DOP …the list of Italian premium ingredients to create gourmet combinations is endless.

With a unique taste and sweet flavour, San Marzano T omatoes are considered by many chefs to be the best tomatoes in the world and the perfect ingredient for an authentic pizza. In 1996 the Italian Legislation has recognized the P .D.O. denomination “Pomodoro San Marzano dell’Agro Sarnese-Noc - erino” in order to protect this precious fruit against the development of other tomato varieties similar in shape but with completely different organoleptic properties. The legislation, along with the characteristic of the plant and fruit, also regulates the areas where the tomatoes can be grown in order to be compliant with the Protected Designation of Origin. San Marzano T omatoes DOP can only be grown in Campania region, specifically in the following areas: Agro Sarnese- Nocerino, Acerrano Nolano, Montono Inferiore and Montono Superiore. T omato sauce is used uncooked, normally with the addition of salt and extra virgin olive oil only. The suggested amount of evo oil and salt to add should be around 1.5% of the tomatoes weight. Here a practical example: 2.5 kg of plum tomatoes, 30g fine sea salt, 30gof EVO oil. According to the personal taste, other ingredients may be added to the tomato sauce, but we recommend to follow our suggestions below in order to preserve the taste of high quality tomatoes: Basil: Can be added to the tomatoes as well, but do not cut the basil leaves or the chlorophyll released will make the sauce bitter; Garlic: It is better lo leave it infuse with the tomatoes for few hours and then remove it before using the sauce; Pepper: According to taste, it is better to freshly grind it at the table rather than adding it to the tomatoes; Origano: Can be used to replace basil. We suggest not to use basil and oregano together .

FRATELLI GALLONI For the production of its Parma Ham, Fratelli Galloni uses only the traditional processing methods in order to safeguard the high quality of real Italian prosciutto. The salting is still carried by hand and the meats, coming exclusively from selected Italian farms, are mainly cured with natural air. The result is an unmistakable mild flavor that you can taste at the first bite. PRODUCER PROFILE",

      "content": "IT ALICA TESSEN » PIZZA GUIDE » 33‘NDUJA It is a particularly spicy, spreadable pork salume from Calabria, in Southern Italy. It is typically made with tripe, shoulder and belly parts of the pig with the addition of abundant chilli peppers. ‘Nduja is now widely used as a pizza topping by many pizzaioli all around the world. T o enjoy it at its best, add the ‘nduja on top of your pizza before cooking it. ‘Nduja is ideal to add a hint of spiciness to any pizza combination. We recommend to pair it with vegetables like broccoli and peppers or delicate cheeses to create new and tasty pizza recipes. MILANO SALAME One of the most famous salami, Salame Milano takes its name from the city of Milan, in Lombardy, region where it is produced. Characterized by a fine ground and a mild and delicate taste with notes of garlic and pepper, Salame Milano is commonly used as a pizza topping paired with fresh rocket or scamorza cheese. SPICY SALAMI (PEPPERONI) Pepperoni is the most common and used pizza topping worldwide. Pepperoni is an English word that does not exist in the Italian dictionary and refers to a dry spicy salami, quite thin, used to add a hint of spiciness in many recipes. Pepperoni is used sliced and spread on the pizza before cooking it and it can be paired with different ingredients, from matured cheese to vegetables, but the traditional recipe calls for tomato sauce, mozzarella and pepperoni only.FRESH SAUSAGE Fresh sausage is a very versatile ingredient that can be easily paired with cheeses, mushrooms and vegetables, like friarielli. We recommend to chop the fresh sausage in small pieces and then sprinkle it on top of the pizza before proceeding with the oven cooking. SPECK South T yrolean Speck is a traditional salumi from Alto Adige (or South T yrol), a province in North-East Italy which includes part of the beautiful Dolomites mountains area. Speck is made following a centuries-old recipe, it is smoked and aged several months to ensure the unique and characteristic pronounced flavour typical of this product. As a pizza topping, speck is commonly used with smoked scamorza to create a balanced combination of flavours. POPULAR MEAT TOPPINGS",

In order to have the same consistency of the dough throughout all the year during different seasons and temperature we need to use a trick or better a formula. We need to take in consideration the T emperature of the Flour , the T emperature of the room and the Friction temperature (this is how many Degrees Celsius the dough increase while kneading in the mixer , each mixer is different). If we want to have the same dough that proof in the same way in August as in January, we want the dough to be at the same Final temperature every day, Ideally around 23 °C Celsius.EXAMPLE *Friction T emperature, as per anticipated each mixer will have a different friction temperature, this depends on the speed of the mixer , the size of the mixing ball and the hydration of the dough. The best way to calculate the friction temperature is having flour and water at the same T emperature of the room, mix it all together and measure again at the end of the mixing by how many °C the T emperature rose. Example, Room T =20°C, Flour T= 20°C, Water T=20°C, mixing for 15 minutes, final Dough T= 32°C, this means the friction T is 12°C for 15 minutes mixing. Note that the longer the mixing the higher the Friction T will be, so always use the same the same settings on the Mixer .

Pizza is without any doubt the most popular and appreciated food in the world. Simple yet tasty, versatile and easy to enjoy everywhere. Perfect for sharing with family and friends pizza can easily satisfy and meet everyone’s taste. Today we can find so many different types of pizza that differ in terms of toppings, thickness and preparation methods, but the traditional authentic Italian pizza as we all know it is made of three simple key ingredients: flour, tomato and fiordilatte mozzarella.WELCOME The origins of this popular food are still uncertain. There are evidences that the Ancient Greeks used to eat slices of flatbread topped with savouries, but it was something far from the pizza as we intend it now, also because tomatoes had only been imported to Europe many centuries later, after Christopher A manual to discover the secrets behind world’s favourite food: Pizza. Colombus discovered America in the XV century. Modern pizza was probably invented by a Neapolitan baker, Raffaele Esposito, in 1889 when in occasion of Queen Margherita and King Umberto I of Savoy visit to Naples, he created a pizza using tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil leaves to represent the colours of the Italian flag.

Despite that, it was only during the first half of the 20th century that pizza became famous all around the world when people from the South of Italy started to migrate to Northern Italy first and then to other countries in Europe and in America.

There are different types of flour, learning the differences between them is fundamental in order to obtain the specific desired result. Flour is obtained from the milling of wheat. There are two different kinds of wheat: 01 FLOUR FOR PIZZA COMMON WHEAT (Triticum Aestivus), also known as bread or soft wheat Characterised by very small round shaped granules and white in colour . It is mainly used to make bread, pizza and bakery products in general, fresh and egg pasta. DURUM WHEAT (Triticum Durum). The flour obtained from durum wheat, instead, is called “semola” and has larger granules with a yellow-amber colour , mainly used for the production of dry pasta. FLOUR FOR PIZZA The flour used for pizza dough is the one obtained from common wheat (called simply wheat), for this reason in this guide we will always refer to common wheat when referring to flour . 1 2",

WhEAT FLOUR CAN bE CLASSIFIED IN: 00, 0, 1, 2 AND wHOLEWhEAT .THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FLOUR ASH CONTENT In Italy, the most common and recognised way to classify the different types of flour is based on the ash or mineral content, which depends on the amount of bran left if we were to burn 100g of flour . The lower the ash content, the whiter the flour since it means it has been produced from the milling of the endosperm only. Wholewheat flour , instead, has the highest level of ash content because the bran and the germ are present as well. Wheat flour can be classified in: 00, 0, 1, 2 and wholewheat.GERMENDOSPERMBRAN Included mainly in whole wheat flour , the bran (the outer part of the kernel) is another part of the kernel used to produce white flour even if in smaller quantities compared to the endosperm. It contains a small amount of protein and large quantities of minerals and of the three major B-vitamins. ENDOSPERM The endosperm is the source of white flour and contains the starch and the greatest amount of protein, carbohy - drates and iron. It is also the source for soluble fibre. GERM The inner part of the kernel, called germ, is normally separated from the flour milling because of its high fat content which compromises the shelf life of the flour . The germ, instead, is present in wholewheat flour and it is also possible to find it in artisanal stone-milled flour. BRAN The percentage of brand and endosperm depends on the refining level (milling and sifting) of the flour . 6 » IT ALICA TESSEN » PIZZA GUIDETYPE OF |FLOURASH CONTENT (% ON 100G OF FLOUR)CHARACTERISTICS RECOMMENDED FOR 00 0.55 It is the most refined type of flour because the bran is completely removed during the milling. The result is a white flour , highly ‘workable’ , rich in starch (and sugar) but poor in fiber and minerals. – Pastry, – Pasta – Bread – Pizza Considering that the dough using ‘00’ flour will be very soft. 0 0.6 Slight less refined then the ‘00’ , with a low bran content. – Baking products, – Pasta – Pastry 1 0.80 With a higher bran content, this less refined flour has a good balance between taste and nutrients content. The level of bran makes it richer in minerals and gives this flour a darker colour compared to the previous more refined ones. Like using the type ‘2’ and ‘wholewheat’ flour , the result is a pizza dough with a pleasant stronger taste and flavour compared to the previous ones. – High quality baking products – Bread – Pizza. 2 0.95 Also know as ‘semi-wholewheat’ flour , it is character - ised by larger granules and a high content of nutrients because of of the content of bran and kernel germ. Like the wholewheat flour , it has excellent nutritional charac - teristics but it is easier to process. – Pizza – Bread – Bakery products Wholewheat 1.30 min; 1.7 maxAs a consequence of a slower milling process, this flour is less refined than the previous ones and as a consequence has a very high nutrients contents, rich in fiber , vitamins, proteins and monerals.

FLOUR STRENGTH (W) ThE hIGHER THE LEVEL OF PROTEIN IN THE FLOUR, THE STRONGER THE FLOUR.Flour “strength” (indicated by the symbol ‘W’) represents the quantity of gluten that the flour develops and its subsequent capability to absorb water. The value of the ‘W’ is correlated to the protein content of the flour . When combined with water , flour proteins (gliadin and glutenin) form a protein complex called Gluten. This is the element that, during the kneading, absorbs water and during the leaving retains the carbon dioxide developed by the yeast. The higher the level of protein in the flour , the stronger the flour . A strong flour generates more gluten and, as a consequence, the dough will absorb more water and it will be more resistant to long raising.

      "content": "12 » IT ALICA TESSEN » PIZZA GUIDE Together with flour, Yeast is the most important ingredient for the preparation of pizza dough. Yeast is the leavening agent which allows the dough to rise. When mixed with flour, yeast feeds on flour sugars and creates alcohol and carbon dioxide, which forms air pockets trapped in the dough. As a result, the dough grows in size during the leavening process and becomes easily digestible. During the baking, the carbon dioxide dissolves leaving empty alveoli which gives the pizza crust an airy and fluffy texture. There are different types of yeast and choosing the right one is fundamental in order to achieve the desired results. DRIED YEAST Instant activate dry yeast is suitable for all kinds of pizza dough and it can be used directly in the flour during the first phase of the kneading. Thanks to its better consistency throughout time, the dried yeast when regenerated and used in the right quantities can give better results than fresh yeast. Instant dry yeast doesn’t need to be re-hydrated before use, simply add it to the dry ingredients of your dough. It is very important not to put the yeast in contact with cold temperatures. Therefore, it is better to mix it with flour before adding water . T o replace fresh yeast in a recipe, the dry yeast should be used in 40/50 % of the quantity of fresh yeast.SOURDOUGH Made from special powdered dried mother yeast, developed in collaboration with the faculty of Biology and genetics of the University of Parma, Le 5 Stagioni Naturkraft presents a perfect balance between the yeasts and the best bacterial lactic strains. It is recommended for all types of dough. When using Naturkraft it is advisable to reduce the quantity of beer yeast in the dough by 20%. 02 YEAST WHY USE SOURDOUGH? The Sourdough enriches the dough with flavors and scents and it allows the lactic fermentation to take place. The benefits of this type of fermentation are: longer shelf life and higher digestibility. Overall, sourdough is a natural dough improver that we highly recommend to use.

      "content": "IT ALICA TESSEN » PIZZA GUIDE » 13 In this chapter we will introduce you the most common ways of making pizza. We will provide you with an overview of what are the steps involved in every method, suggestions and recommendations. Please consider that there are many factors that can affect the process of making pizza (temperature, humidity, strength of the flour and so on). For this reason, the information provided below have to be considered as general guidelines that may have to be adapted to the specific need and situation. The main ingredients of pizza dough are flour, yeast, water and salt. The different methods used to prepare the pizza dough affect the quantity and the order in which these ingredients are mixed together. DIRECT DOUGH Direct dough is the traditional and most common method to make the dough, which donates the classic flavor and aroma to the pizza. It is based on alcoholic fermentation, obtained thanks to Brewer’s Y east (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae) and offers excellent results. Direct dough is made mixing all the ingredients - flour, water, salt and yeast (fresh or dry) - together. This is the most popular way of making pizza. It guarantees consistency to the dough, high digestibility and it is easy and quick to make. Based on the strength of the flour we use, we may opt for a direct method with short or long fermentation. The direct method with a short leavening time can be used with flour with a W (strength) around 220. After mixing and kneading all the ingredients together , the dough is left to rest and proof for a first fermentation that can last around 15-20 minutes. This step is followed by the shaping of the dough and by a second, longer proofing for about 8 - 12 hours at room temperature or until it doubles in size, before being ready to be used. Like the short one, the direct method with a long fermentation starts mixing all the ingredients together , but this time a stronger flour (with a W of at least 240) is needed. Another important factor to consider is that if we opt for a long fermentation, the quantity of yeast has to be reduced compared to the short method. Once kneaded, the dough is left resting at room temperature for around 20 minutes, covered with cling film. After this first short proofing, the dough has to be placed in the fridge at a temperature between +4° +6° C degrees for a time that can vary between a minimum of 12 hours to a maximum of 96 hours depending on the strength of the flour and the final product that we want to obtain. 03 WAYS OF MAKING PIZZA The most common methods of making pizza dough can be classified in: - Direct Dough - Indirect Dough: - Biga - Poolish - Natural YeastDIRECT DOUGh IS MADE MIXING ALL THE INGREDIENTS - FLOUR, wATER, SALT AND yEAST (FRESh OR DR y) - TOGETHER.",

      "content": "14 » IT ALICA TESSEN » PIZZA GUIDEINDIRECT DOUGH BIGA Biga was born in Italy and responds to the need to imitate the excellent results offered by the use of Mother Y east (or Natural Y east or Sourdough), without necessarily having to submit to its management methods, often considered too demanding. When making Biga, two types of fermentation are involved: the alcoholic and the lactic fermentation. This is why the taste of the final products obtained with this method reminds of the one of the Mother Y east (mostly of a “lactic” nature), without having to take care of periodic refreshments of the yeast.Biga is made using a strong flour with a strength between 280W and 400W. The preparation takes place in two distinct phases. In the first phase, flour is mixed with water and yeast. The hydration is low, from 30% to 50% of the dough (biga, in fact, is a dry pre-dough) and the quantity of dried yeast used is around 6g for each kg of flour . The temperature of the pre-dough should be constantly around 20-22° C degrees. In the second step, after a proofing time of 18 – 24 hours, the Biga is refreshed with flour , water and salt. Water has to be added in larger quantity compared to the flour , in order to rebalance the dough. CLASSIC BIGA (30% hydration) DOUGH MADE WITH BIGA (large air pockets) On the other hand, another way to make pizza dough is using the indirect methods which involve a “pre-dough” , that can be classified in “Biga” and “Poolish”. In the first phase, the pre-dough is made using flour, water and yeast and it is left to proof. In the second phase, the main dough is made refreshing the pre-dough with the rest of the ingredients.

BOTH IMPROVE THE AROMA AND FLAVORS OF THE DOUGHS IN WHICH THEY ARE USED, THANKS TO THE PROLONGED MA TURA TION TO WHICH THEY ARE SUBJECT , BUT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT ORIGINS AND EFFECTS. Compared to the direct dough, this method involves a lower quantity of yeast and as a result it ensures a better digestibility of the final product, a more intense taste and aroma, a better alveolation and a more extended shelf life.",

The origins of its name are not clear yet, but it was probably named “Poolish” after the country where it was invented, Poland. It is characterized by a very high hydration and a homogeneous and dense alveolation. The final result using this method is a product with a long shelf life, highly digestible, fragrant and crusty. Differently from Biga, which is dry, Poolish has a liquid texture and is obtained by mixing together water and flour (with a W of at least 250) in the same proportion, with the addition of a percentage of yeast that differs based on the proofing time: – 1-2 hours proofing: 2.5% of yeast; – 4-5 hours proofing: 1.5% of yeast; – 6-7 hours proofing: 1% of yeast; – 8-9 hours proofing: 0.5% of yeast; – 10-12 hours proofing: 0.3% of yeast; – 13-14 hours proofing: 0.2% of yeast; – 15-16 hours proofing: 0.1% of yeast. (the quantity of yeast is expressed as a percentage of the flour weight) The ideal proofing temperature is 23C degrees circa. Poolish is ready once it has doubled its volume and when it forms a sort of dip in the middle. The percentage of Poolish normally used is between 20% and 35% of the total flour indicated on the recipe. After the fermentation, the Poolish is refreshed with water , flour and salt and then kneaded. After this step, the dough is left to rest for around 20 minutes before proceeding with the creation of dough balls.

Natural yeast donates unique aromas and flavors to the dough and dramatically increases the shelf-life of the final product, hindering the retrogradation of starches. Natural Y east is a mixture of flour and water subjected to spontaneous contamination by microorganisms (for the most part “yeasts”) present in the raw materials, coming from the air , from the environment, from the operator . These factors create a native bacterial microflora within the mass in which the culture of lactic bacteria predominates. Natural Y east is usually made mixing the water with Manitoba and a bit of sugar . It has to be let proof spon- taneously for 48 hours. After that, it needs to be refreshed daily with water and flour for at least 14 days before being used. The lactic bacteria present in sourdough preparations lower the pH of the pizza dough, helping to degrade the phytates. This produces doughs with a much lower phytate content than regular ones, which can be as much as 25-50% less. Natural Y east is commonly used to make bread and long leavening bakery products, but it can also be used for the pizza dough. The result will be a final product with a higher acidity, an intense aromatic bouquet, highly digestible and fragrant.

The Associazione states that the Pizza Napoletana has to be round shaped, with a diameter smaller than 35cm, has to present a thick fluffy edge and the pizza needs to be fragrant and soft. Also, authentic pizza Napoletana has the classic leopard skin on the edge, given by the high temperatures of the woodfired oven, but cannot have any burnt bits. For the sauce, recommended are hand-crushed peeled tomatoes, not too thick and with little bits of tomatoes still present in the sauce.

The use of mother yeast or biga is mandatory to ensure a dough that is soft, perfectly consistent and easily digestible. The visual presentation is very important when it comes to gourmet pizzas. A real gourmet pizza has to be served already cut in wedges and every sliced is considered a single “boccone” (bite) with the right amount of ingredients on top. Finding a list of ingredients to use to create a gourmet pizza is almost impossible, since every pizzaiolo can create their own combination of flavours and aromas. The most important aspect to consider is the quality of the ingredients that have to be excellent and authentic to create unique gourmet pairings. Burrata, Stracciatel- la, ‘nduja, porcini mushrooms, fresh truffles, caviar , Prosciutto di Parma DOP , Pesto DOP …the list of Italian premium ingredients to create gourmet combinations is endless.

With a unique taste and sweet flavour, San Marzano T omatoes are considered by many chefs to be the best tomatoes in the world and the perfect ingredient for an authentic pizza. In 1996 the Italian Legislation has recognized the P .D.O. denomination “Pomodoro San Marzano dell’Agro Sarnese-Noc - erino” in order to protect this precious fruit against the development of other tomato varieties similar in shape but with completely different organoleptic properties. The legislation, along with the characteristic of the plant and fruit, also regulates the areas where the tomatoes can be grown in order to be compliant with the Protected Designation of Origin. San Marzano T omatoes DOP can only be grown in Campania region, specifically in the following areas: Agro Sarnese- Nocerino, Acerrano Nolano, Montono Inferiore and Montono Superiore. T omato sauce is used uncooked, normally with the addition of salt and extra virgin olive oil only. The suggested amount of evo oil and salt to add should be around 1.5% of the tomatoes weight. Here a practical example: 2.5 kg of plum tomatoes, 30g fine sea salt, 30gof EVO oil. According to the personal taste, other ingredients may be added to the tomato sauce, but we recommend to follow our suggestions below in order to preserve the taste of high quality tomatoes: Basil: Can be added to the tomatoes as well, but do not cut the basil leaves or the chlorophyll released will make the sauce bitter; Garlic: It is better lo leave it infuse with the tomatoes for few hours and then remove it before using the sauce; Pepper: According to taste, it is better to freshly grind it at the table rather than adding it to the tomatoes; Origano: Can be used to replace basil. We suggest not to use basil and oregano together .

Protected by the Designation of Origin, Prosciutto di Parma DOP can only be produced on the hills around Parma, in Emilia Romagna, and the production process has to follow strict and controlled rules. Prosciutto di Parma is made using only two ingredients: Italian pork meat (the haunch) and sea salt. These ingredients combined with a long natural seasoning process make it possible to obtained a cured ham with unique organoleptic properties. When used as a pizza topping, we recommend to add Prosciutto di Parma at the end, before serving the pizza, in order to preserve its mild taste and delicate texture.",

In order to have the same consistency of the dough throughout all the year during different seasons and temperature we need to use a trick or better a formula. We need to take in consideration the T emperature of the Flour , the T emperature of the room and the Friction temperature (this is how many Degrees Celsius the dough increase while kneading in the mixer , each mixer is different). If we want to have the same dough that proof in the same way in August as in January, we want the dough to be at the same Final temperature every day, Ideally around 23 °C Celsius.EXAMPLE *Friction T emperature, as per anticipated each mixer will have a different friction temperature, this depends on the speed of the mixer , the size of the mixing ball and the hydration of the dough. The best way to calculate the friction temperature is having flour and water at the same T emperature of the room, mix it all together and measure again at the end of the mixing by how many °C the T emperature rose. Example, Room T =20°C, Flour T= 20°C, Water T=20°C, mixing for 15 minutes, final Dough T= 32°C, this means the friction T is 12°C for 15 minutes mixing. Note that the longer the mixing the higher the Friction T will be, so always use the same the same settings on the Mixer .
